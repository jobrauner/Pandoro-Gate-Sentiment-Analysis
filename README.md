# Pandoro_Gate_Sentiment_Analysis

This project analyzes public sentiment surrounding the highly publicized *Pandoro-gate* scandal involving Italian influencer **Chiara Ferragni** and the **Balocco** brand. The controversy, centered on alleged fraudulent charity marketing practices, led to a severe reputational crisis and significant economic losses for her brand sponsors.

Using **web scraping techniques**, comments were collected across multiple social media platforms, including **Instagram**, **Facebook**, **Reddit**, **Quora**, and **Twitter**. The data was then preprocessed through a comprehensive **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** pipeline, including:

* Tokenization
* Lemmatization
* Stemming
* Stopword removal
* Lowercasing
* Punctuation and emoji handling

To accurately capture the **contextual sentiment** in user comments, we employed transformer-based models such as **BERT**, which excels at understanding nuance and implicit meaning in text.

The objective was to:

* Measure public sentiment evolution over time
* Understand reputational impact
* Provide actionable insights for brand and crisis management

This project demonstrates the power of **context-aware NLP models** in analyzing complex real-world events and public opinion at scale.
